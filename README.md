### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Andreas, and I do web stuff. I plan for this markdown file to serve as an index of all my projects in the future, as GitHub doesn't have many good ways of compartmentalising things... But for now, you can read a little about me below

# What can I do?
What can't I do really... Okay, most things, but here is a list of some of the things that I am at least somewhat proficient at:

### Languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SQL
- A little C# and PHP

### Technologies:
- Vue
- Node
- .NET (so-so)

### Programmes:
- Adobe XD
- Adobe Ilustrator

### Skills:
- uhm...

More to come, this is very much a work in progress :)
